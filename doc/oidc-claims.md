# SAC/CAS specific OIDC claims

In the SAC wagon, some additional attributes are added to the OIDC claims.

## Profile picture URL

The `name` and `with_roles` scope additionally yield the profile picture URL of the user who just logged in. The profile picture URL is exposed in the Userinfo endpoint.

## layer_group_id in `with_roles` scope

For easily determining the Sektion / Ortsgruppe / Nationalverband (used by third-party-applications for authorization), the `layer_group_id` of each role's group is exposed in the `with_roles` claims.

## New scope `user_groups`

For "easily parsing" the presence or absence of certain role combinations by some third-party applications, a new scope `user_groups` was introduced.
This scope adds a claim with the key `user_groups` to the userinfo endpoint. The contents of this claim is a JSON list of strings. Each string represents either directly an active role (e.g. `"Group::Geschaeftsstelle::Mitarbeiter#8"` for a role of type `Group::Geschaeftsstelle::Mitarbeiter` in the group with id 8), or a compounded / "calculated role" such as `"SAC_employee"` which, if present in the userinfo endpoint, stands for "the user has any active role in any `Geschaeftsstelle` group".

The name of this scope and claim is a compromise: These "calculated roles" are used for deriving the permissions of the user in third-party applications. Many third-party applications use permission mechanism which they refer to internally as "groups" (as in, Benutzergruppen). However, in hitobito, "roles" are used for assigning and grouping permissions, and "groups" as a term is used for a different concept. The term "user_groups" presents a middle-ground, being close to the Benutzergruppen of the third-party applications, but still distinct from hitobito's "groups".
