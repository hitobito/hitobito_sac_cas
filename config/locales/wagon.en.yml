Deletion has the following consequences for you: If you wish to rejoin the SAC at a later date, you will have to pay the joining fee again and your number of years of membership will start from zero. Any qualifications you have obtained and training courses you have completed (including training hours) will be deleted. Your SAC login will be deleted and you will no longer be able to use it for other purposes (e.g. for the SAC app). If you do not want this, you must allow us to keep your data after you leave.
